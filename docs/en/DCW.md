DCW is training-free, adds negligible compute, and has been validated across a
wide range of diffusion models — including **FLUX**, which shares ACE-Step's
flow-matching formulation.

## What it does

During **training**, every noised sample `x_t` has an SNR that is strictly
coupled to its timestep `t`. At **inference** the sampler steps through a
*predicted* trajectory, so the actual SNR of `x_t` drifts away from what the
network was trained to see at that `t`. This *SNR-t bias* accumulates along
the denoising chain and hurts quality — most visibly at intermediate / high
timesteps.

The authors' key observation is that diffusion models reconstruct
**low-frequency content before high-frequency content** during the reverse
process. Therefore the SNR-t drift affects different frequency bands
differently, and the correction should be applied **per-band** (wavelet
domain) rather than directly on the latent.

### Per-step update

Given the current latent `x`, velocity prediction `v`, and timestep `t_curr`:

```text
x_next   = sampler_step(x, v, t_curr)      # normal Euler / Heun / flow-matching
denoised = x - v * t_curr                  # predicted clean sample x_0

xL, xH   = DWT(x_next)
yL, yH   = DWT(denoised)

xL       = xL + λ_low  * (xL - yL)         # "low" mode   (Eq. 18 / 20)
xH[j]    = xH[j] + λ_high * (xH[j] - yH[j])  # "high" mode (Eq. 18 / 21)
x_next   = IDWT(xL, xH)
```

**Per-band schedule** (matches the paper's Eq. 20 / 21, following the
EDM reference in `AMAP-ML/DCW/generate.py`):

- `λ_low  = t_curr * dcw_scaler` — strongest at high noise / early
  steps, decays to 0 as `t → 0`.  Matches the intuition that low-frequency
  content is painted first in the reverse process.
- `λ_high = (1 − t_curr) * dcw_scaler` — **complementary** schedule,
  strongest at low noise / late steps when the network is actually
  painting high-frequency detail.
- `double` mode: low band uses `t_curr * dcw_scaler`, high band uses
  `(1 − t_curr) * dcw_high_scaler` independently.
- `pix` mode: raw `dcw_scaler` with no `t` modulation, matching the
  reference FLUX scheduler's pixel-space baseline.

ACE-Step latents are 1-D temporal tensors of shape `[B, T, 64]` at 25 Hz,
so DCW uses a 1-D DWT along the `T` axis.

## Installation

DCW's PyTorch-path wavelet transforms use `pytorch_wavelets` + `PyWavelets`.
Both are declared in `pyproject.toml`, so a normal `uv sync` already
installs them — nothing extra to do. On the MLX path, `haar` runs natively
in MLX (no Python wavelet deps needed); non-Haar bases bridge to the same
`pytorch_wavelets` modules.

If, for some reason, `pytorch_wavelets` is missing from the environment
when DCW is enabled, the pipeline logs a clear warning and falls back to
the normal sampler — no crash.

## Parameters

All DCW parameters live on `GenerationParams` in `acestep/inference.py` and
are forwarded through the generation handler chain into the base model's
`generate_audio`.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dcw_enabled` | `Optional[bool]` | `None` | Model-aware default: enabled for Turbo and disabled for non-Turbo. Set explicitly for a controlled A/B. |
| `dcw_mode` | `str` | `"double"` | One of `"low"`, `"high"`, `"double"`, `"pix"`. |
| `dcw_scaler` | `float` | `0.05` | Low-band correction strength (or the single scaler for `"high"` / `"pix"`). Usable range `0–0.1`. |
| `dcw_high_scaler` | `float` | `0.02` | High-band correction strength (used only when `dcw_mode == "double"`). Usable range `0–0.1`. |
| `dcw_wavelet` | `str` | `"haar"` | PyWavelets basis name — e.g. `"haar"`, `"db4"`, `"sym8"`. |

### Mode reference

- **`low`** — Correct only the low-frequency band.  Schedule
  `t_curr * dcw_scaler` — strongest at high noise, decays to 0 near
  `t=0`.  Matches the paper's `dcw_low` example and is the recommended
  starting point for ACE-Step.  (Note: the FLUX scheduler in
  AMAP-ML/DCW ships with `pix` as the *active* line and `dcw_low` /
  `dcw_high` commented out — so treat `low` as a sensible default, not
  a canonical one.)
- **`high`** — Correct only the high-frequency detail band.  Schedule
  `(1 - t_curr) * dcw_scaler` — **complementary** to `low`: near-zero
  at high noise, strongest as `t → 0`, because high-frequency content
  is painted later in the reverse process.
- **`double`** — Correct both bands, with independent `dcw_scaler`
  (applied to low with `t` schedule) and `dcw_high_scaler` (applied
  to high with `(1-t)` schedule).  ACE-Step extension; the reference
  implementation does not expose a separate high-band scaler.
- **`pix`** — No wavelet transform; correction is applied directly in
  latent space with the **raw** `dcw_scaler` (no `t` modulation),
  matching the reference FLUX scheduler.  Useful both as an ablation
  and as a "closest-to-reference" baseline.

## Usage example (Python API)

```python
from acestep.inference import GenerationConfig, GenerationParams, generate_music

# `dit_handler` and `llm_handler` come from the standard ACE-Step setup;
# see docs/en/INFERENCE.md for how they're constructed.

params = GenerationParams(
    caption="mellow lo-fi hiphop with jazzy piano",
    duration=30.0,
    inference_steps=32,
    guidance_scale=7.5,
    # Enable DCW:
    dcw_enabled=True,
    dcw_mode="double",
    dcw_scaler=0.05,
    dcw_high_scaler=0.02,
    dcw_wavelet="haar",
)
config = GenerationConfig(batch_size=1)
result = generate_music(
    dit_handler=dit_handler,
    llm_handler=llm_handler,
    params=params,
    config=config,
)
```

### Usage example (Gradio UI)

Open the standard Gradio UI, expand **Advanced DiT** → **🧪 DCW – Differential
Correction in Wavelet domain (experimental)**, and tune the four
sliders/dropdowns inside. **Enable DCW** defaults on for Turbo and off for
non-Turbo models. This prevents the experimental correction from accumulating
over the 32–50 step Base/SFT schedules while keeping the established Turbo
behavior. The default strengths follow the current Think state:
non-Think uses `scaler=0.05`, `high_scaler=0.02`, while Think uses
`scaler=0.02`, `high_scaler=0.06`.

## Recommended starting values

The opt-in parameter values come from a grid search on the pure-DiT path (no LLM
think-CoT): `dcw_mode="double"`, `dcw_scaler=0.05`,
`dcw_high_scaler=0.02`, `dcw_wavelet="haar"`.  In LLM-think mode the
overall DCW gain is small and the optimum band drifts slightly, so Gradio
switches to `dcw_scaler=0.02` and `dcw_high_scaler=0.06` when Think is
enabled.  Direct Python callers can override these values on
`GenerationParams`; the HTTP generation routes currently use the model-aware
default and do not expose per-request `dcw_*` fields.

- `"low"` alone (`dcw_scaler=0.02`) is a safer, more conservative
  setting if `"double"` sounds too aggressive for a given track.
- Usable scaler range is `0–0.1`; going above that tends to introduce
  audible artefacts.
- Try different wavelet bases (`db4`, `sym8`) for smoother low-band
  extraction; `haar` is the default and fastest, with a blocky low-pass
  response.

## Scope

DCW is wired into every ACE-Step sampler path:

- **PyTorch**: `base`, `sft`, `turbo`, `xl_base`, `xl_sft`, `xl_turbo`.
- **MLX** (Apple Silicon): native Haar plus a `pytorch_wavelets` bridge
  for non-Haar bases — same `dcw_*` kwargs produce the same output.
- **Gradio UI**: all four controls live under **Advanced DiT → 🧪 DCW**.

## Deterministic diffusion trace

Set `ACESTEP_DIFFUSION_TRACE` to a JSONL file before starting inference:

```bash
ACESTEP_DIFFUSION_TRACE=output/xl-sft-trace.jsonl python cli.py -c xl-sft.toml
```

Each record contains a stable stage name, shape, dtype, finite-value statistics,
L2 norm, and SHA-256 fingerprint of the float32 tensor bytes. No timestamps or
random identifiers are included, so runs with the same seed can be compared
line by line. The MLX path records the initial noise and every raw velocity,
guided velocity, sampler update, and optional DCW update. PyTorch records the
conditioning tensors, DCW before/after tensors, and final diffusion target.

The trace does not store prompts, lyrics, audio, or raw tensor contents. It does
contain seeds, tensor fingerprints, shapes, and summary statistics that can
correlate repeated runs, so treat it as diagnostic data and share it only when
intended. Newly created trace files request user-only permissions (`0600`) on
platforms that support POSIX file modes. On platforms with `O_NOFOLLOW`, trace
output also refuses symbolic-link targets rather than appending through them.
Trace output accepts only regular files and opens configured targets in
non-blocking mode where supported, so FIFO and other special-file targets are
skipped without delaying inference.
